# Fraud Detection

## Overview

Fraud detection is at the heart of my career. Over the years, I have developed and optimized fraud prevention strategies using advanced data analytics and machine learning techniques. I have led initiatives to combat financial fraud, account takeovers, and transaction fraud.

## My Approach to Fraud Detection

1. **Data Collection and Cleaning**
   - Collecting clean and structured data for fraud detection models.
   - Handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the data.

2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Creating meaningful features from raw data to improve model accuracy.
   - Techniques include user behavior analysis, transaction patterns, and anomaly detection.

3. **Modeling**
   - Building and training models using machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, XGBoost, and Neural Networks.
   - Testing models for accuracy and optimizing hyperparameters.

4. **Deployment and Monitoring**
   - Deploying fraud detection models to production.
   - Continuously monitoring model performance and retraining when necessary.

## Key Projects

### **Real-Time Fraud Detection System**
A project where I developed a real-time fraud detection system for financial transactions. The system used ensemble models to flag suspicious activity and prevent fraudulent transactions in real-time.
