# Technical Expertise

## Overview

With a strong technical background, I have hands-on experience with several tools and frameworks used in data science, machine learning, and fraud detection systems. This section highlights the technologies I specialize in and how I use them in my work.

## Technologies I Work With

1. **Machine Learning Frameworks**
   - **TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-learn**: Used for building machine learning models, from classification to regression tasks.
   - **XGBoost, LightGBM**: Implementing ensemble models for fraud detection and risk assessment.

2. **Big Data Technologies**
   - **Hadoop, Spark**: Analyzing large datasets in distributed computing environments.
   - **SQL & NoSQL Databases**: Working with relational and non-relational databases to store and query data efficiently.

3. **Cloud Platforms**
   - **AWS, Azure, Google Cloud**: Deploying fraud detection models and other data science projects to the cloud for scalability.

4. **Data Visualization**
   - **Tableau, Power BI, Matplotlib, Seaborn**: Creating visual dashboards to monitor fraud detection metrics and marketing campaign performance.
